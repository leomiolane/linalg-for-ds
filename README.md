# Optimization and Computational Linear Algebra for Data Science

This repository contains some notes for the course, as well as the homeworks.
**These materials are not meant to be proper lecture notes.**
They only contain the main results from the course. Examples, figures, and many proofs are missing.

You can download all the notes [here](https://github.com/leomiolane/linalg-for-ds/raw/master/notes.zip) in *.zip* format.
